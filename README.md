## Earth Institute LIVE 2020
This repository holds codes developed for the K-12 [EI Live](https://www.earth.columbia.edu/videos/channel/k12-education) 2020 series presented in two parts in May 2020. 
[Part 1 of 2: Data Storytelling in Python (Grades 10-12)](https://www.earth.columbia.edu/videos/view/part-1-of-2-data-storytelling-in-python-grades-10-12)
[Part 2 of 2: A Deep Dive into Earthquake Sonification with Python](https://www.earth.columbia.edu/videos/view/part-2-of-2-a-deep-dive-into-earthquake-sonification-with-python-grades-10-12)
These Jupyter Notebooks produce interactive plots (via Bokeh and HoloViews), which allow students to explore the data on their own. The presentations are aimed at grades 10--12. The full walkthrough and interactive plots can be found here: https://jbrussell.github.io/eilive2020/

Part 1 is focused primarily on exploration of earthquake patterns and plate tectonics. In **ExploreEarthquakes**, we look at patterns in global earthquake distributions, at what depths earthquakes occur, and how earthquake magnitudes are distributed. In **NYC_SeismicNoise_and_Electricity**, we explore the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on human activity in New York City using ground vibration data from the Central Park seismometer. We also compare this to NYC electricity consumption and find that both ground vibrations and electricity consumption drop as people begin to quarantine.

Part 2 focuses on data sonification -- the transformation of data into audible sound, which augments our ability to perceive patterns in complex data. In **earthquake_sonification**, we start off with simple waveform shapes in order to build intuition about how the frequency and amplitude of a wave alters what we hear. We then move on to listening to earthquakes as well as the NYC ground vibrations from Part 1.
